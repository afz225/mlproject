(I.7) if there are people besides them in this city. Amasis said to him: Who is it that I can ask so that he can tell me
(I.8) how the city was destroyed? Te-obest-ephonychos, the Lesonis, said to him: There is no man who
(I.9) will be able to tell (I.8) (I.9) how this city was destroyed, except Peteesis, Son of Oudja-semtheus, that temple scribe.
(1.10) It is he who [will] tell you the truth. Amasis called for me. He said to me: Tell me how [
(I.11) the city (I.10) was destroyed! (I.11) I said to him: Are you coming south (?) To cause me to receive blows? I myself
(I.12) have made peace with [...] man. I won't be able to tell you what happened to this city. Amasis [said:] It is you who
(I.13) destroys this city more than the people who destroy it! [He ordered his (?)] Men to guard me. He let [
(I.14) me on his ship] ff (I.13) who [(I.14)] said: I will take you to the Senti. The only reason I didn't hit you is because you are an old [
(I.15) ter] (I.14) man. (I.15) You would (otherwise) have [died]. Amasis came to Herakleopolis. He said to me: Now finally! Will you tell me [
(I.16) how] El-Hibe was destroyed? I said to him: If I get to the Senti and find out that [
(I.17) the Senti [will] protect El-Hibe, I will report to him about everything that is happening in El-Hibe. Amasis said to me: They [
(I.18) will make you] listen to me, because you are not a man. He ordered two men to guard me, saying: Let him [stand] in the sun until I (?) [
(I.19)] of] everything [hear (?)] That has happened in El-Hibe. I suffered great agony in the sun. I said to him: Have a piece
(II.1) of papyrus (I.19) brought, (II.1) so that I can write down everything that has happened. Amasis gave me a piece of papyrus. I wrote down everything that had happened to destroy
(II.2) El-Hibe (II.1). (II.2) Amasis read the papyrus. He exclaimed loudly. He said to me: At Re! I have recognized that it is you who are right,
(II.3) saying: If I tell you the things that have happened to me, these priests will kill me. He sealed the papyrus. He made him seal me with him.
(II.4) He gave it to a man. He had him taken to the house where the Senti was. Amasis stayed in Herakleopolis while completing
(II.5) his affairs (II.4). (II.5) He released me. I came to El-Hibe. It was a few days that passed. Pchoiphis, son of Pef-tjaou-aoui-amounis, came
(II.6) to El-Hibe. He brought the papyrus that Amasis had me write to the priests. They seized me, my son and four brothers
(II.7) from me. They put us in the block (?). They locked us in a temple building. Pchoiphis deposed
(II.8) Te-obest-ephonychos, son of Inaros, as Lesonis. He had him handcuffed. He had him thrown at the place
(II.9) where (II.8) we were. (II.9) He had Inaros, son of Peteapis, (as Lesonis) follow him. There came month 2, Peret, (day) 13, the festival of Shu. All people who were in El-Hibe
(II.10) drank beer. (Also) the guards who were placed over us drank beer. They fell asleep. Te-obest-ephonychos,
(II.11) son of Inaros, (II.10) ran away. (II.11) The guards awoke. They did not find Te-obest-ephonychos. The guards who were placed over us (II.11) above
(II.12) went away. (II.12) Ina [ros], son of Peteapis, the Lesonis, heard (of it). He came to the temple with his brothers and their
(II.13) clubs. They came over us. They beat <us> to death. They only let go of us when they said: They are dead. They carried us
(II.14) away to an old tower that was above the gate of the temple. They threw us in,
(II.15) saying that they would let it collapse on us. Esortaios, son of Peteesis came and called out loudly: Do you
(II.16) want to kill people (II.15) in broad daylight? (II.16) This thing that you do, it will get to the senti. She will go to the
(II.17) Colonel of Egypt (II.16). (II.17)It is six priests who you want to kill by saying: We will bring a tower
(II.18) down on them (II.17). (II.18) I will not be able to avoid writing the Senti about it. If one hears it, one will kill you by saying: Down, down with
(II.19) El-Hibe because of this! You won't be able to be in a city where people are. They got us out of the tower. They carried us
(II.20) into the temple area. It was like there was no old person among them except me. My heart failed. I did not know
(III.1) what else was happening in the world. They thought: Peteese won't live an hour. They let me
(III.2) be carried into my house (III.1). (III.2) I passed four days without knowing any circumstance that I was in. I spent three months under the hand of the doctors
(III.3) before the wounds on me had healed. □ At night I boarded a wooden freighter
(III.4) and came to Memphis. I spent seven months complaining to the Senti and his grandees, while Pchoiphis, son of
(III.5) Pef-tjaou-aoui-amounis, ordered everyone: Do not let him reach the Senti. Semtou-tefnachthes, son of Chaonnophris, recognized us
(III.6) and I told him the things that had happened to me. And he made me appear in front of the Senti. The Senti sent for them four times
(III.7), but they did not come. They didn't come until the fifth time. The penalty imposed on them was to give them
(III.8) 50 lashes per man (III.7) (III.8) and then release them. They went to Semtou-tefnachthes, son of Chaonnophris. and said: We
(III.9) will provide you and your brother and your three sons with sacrificial income, a total of five sacrificial income. Have papyrus brought, then we will
(III.10) lease your five sacrificial income today. Semtou-tefnachthes had a piece of papyrus brought. They leased his
(III.11) five (III.10) victim income. (III.11) Semtou-tefnachthes went in front of the Senti, saying: O may he make the lifetime of Re! These priests - see,
(III.12) the Senti had them punished (III.11). (III.12) Your case here is obsolete. May the Senti release her! He caused
(III.13) the Senti (III.12) to exclaim: (III.13) as follows: You should go away! It happened that the evening before the Senti I appeared together with
(III.14) Semtou-tefnachthes. I said in front of the Senti: The portion of the prophet of the Amun of El-Hibe belonged to my father
(III.15) together with 16 other portions of the prophet of the gods of El-Hibe. And he was given 16 sacrificial shares in her name. It was my
(III.16) father who went to Syria with King Psammetich Neferibre with Amun's bouquet
(III.17). The priests went to Haryotes son of Harchebis [the ruler of] Herakleopolis and said: The portion of the prophet of Amun of El-Hibe is a king's portion.
(III.18) A priest of Amun (however) took him when he was ruler of Herakleopolis. See, he (the portion) is in the possession of his son's son to this day.
(III.19) Behold, he has gone with the king into the Syrian land, (so) let Ptah-nefer, son of Haryotes, your son, come, then
(III.20) we will give him the share of the prophet of Amun of El -Hibe! He sent Ptah-nefer, his son, to El-Hibe. They assigned him the portion of the prophet of Amun.

(7) [(and since) he has already made] many [expenses] in order to rest in Egypt to create (and) to strengthen the temples, (and since) he has already given gifts to the whole army that was under his rule, the taxes and duties that existed in Egypt, he reduced them (or) he waived them entirely to make things go well for the army and all other people in his time

(9) [temples] (8), (9) and the portions which the gods receive from the vineyards, the orchards and all the rest of the things that they owned in his father's time, to let them remain in their possession. He has also ordered the priests not to make them pay more of their priestly tax than what they had paid up to the first year of reign in his father's time. He has exempted the people
(10) [who were in] the offices of the temples from the annual voyages they made to Alexandria (9). (10) He has given orders not to raise rowers. He decreed two-thirds of the linen that the temples gave to the palace. All things that have been out of their state for a long time, he brings them into their equilibrium of (?)
(11) [...] using every care to cause that which is habitual for the gods to be done is done in an appropriate manner.

(12) [they return] to their places and that their belongings remain in their possession.

(13) "which" was fortified by the rebels with all work, with many weapons and all equipment inside.

(16) earlier (15) rebelled against them in the said places. (16) The rebels who gathered troops, taking their head, to confuse the Gaue, by damaging the temples and leaving the path of the king and his father - the gods caused him to gain power over them took place in Memphis at the feast of his father receiving the office of ruler. He arranged for them to be killed on the wood. He waived the remainder (17) for the king on the part of the temples up to reign 9 (16),
(17) which made up large numbers of silver and grain. Likewise (he decreed) the value of the linen that the temples drew from what they gave to the palace, as well as the remainder determined from what they had given up to the said date. He also ordered it as to Artabe wheat per one (aure) field which was drawn in from the fields of God's sacrifice. Just
(18) so (he has issued) the wine per one (aurea) field from the vineyards of the divine offerings of the gods. He refrained from it. He did much good for Apis, Mnevis and the other animals that are sacred in Egypt, more than what those who were before him did, by keeping his heart on their cause at all times, by doing that gave what was desired for their great and plentiful burials, bringing what is set
(19) in their temples when feasts are made (and) burnt offerings made before them along with all the other things that are to be done befits.

He caused the work to be completed anew as
(20) very beautiful (19) work. (20) He caused temples, chapels (and) altars to be redone for the gods. He caused others to be of their kind by being of benevolent heart with regard to the gods (and) asking for the gods' honors to be appropriately renewed in his time as king. As a reward for this, the gods have given him strength, bravery, victory, well-being,
(21) health and all the other benefits (20), (21) by establishing his royal office under him and his children for eternity . Good luck for!
