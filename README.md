# Ahmed ELshabrawy's Project (CSCI-GA 2565)
The Main Code is in code.py (I take no credit for it) which was adapted from the PyTorch tutorial on Seq2seq models here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html. The various corpora are in the training folder, not all files are being trained on some are intermediate files needed to prepare the data. Links for the corpora are as follows:

http://129.206.5.162/ #Demotic Palaeographical Database Project  

The 3 major data sets are in the training folder are:  
demotic-english.txt #Experiment 1  
Egyptian-english.txt #Experiment 2  
Egyptian2-english.txt #Experiment 3  

test.py was used to carry out various tests on the models.


The rest of the python files are all for data processing.

The experiments folder contains the save states of all the different experiments.
